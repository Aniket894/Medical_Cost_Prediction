Laptops Price Prediction

Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the Laptops Price Prediction project, where we aim to build a machine learning model to predict the prices of laptops based on various features.

Project Description

In this project, we are focused on developing a robust and accurate laptops price prediction model using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various attributes of laptops, such as CPU, Screen,GPU,Storage,and much more.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the data directory. It includes the following columns:

Brand:the Brand of the laptop
CPU: the CPU information of the laptop
RAM:the RAM information of the laptop
Storage: the storage information of the laptop
Storage type: tells what is the  storage type of the laptop
GPU: tells that which GPU is used in the laptop
Screen:tells the screen size of the laptop
Touch: tells the laptop is touchable or not
Final price: tells about the price of laptop

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.9
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these dependencies using pip with the provided requirements.txt file.

Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip.
Run the Jupyter notebook model_trainer.ipynb to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new data by calling the appropriate functions in the notebook.
Results
We have achieved promising results with our laptops price prediction model. In the notebook, you can find the evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), which provide insights into the model's performance.

Future Improvements
While the current model demonstrates good performance, there is always room for improvement. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, such as XGBoost, Random Forest, or Neural Networks, to see if they can yield better results.
Perform more extensive feature engineering to potentially discover additional relevant features.
Explore hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model's performance further.
Consider collecting more data or enriching the dataset with additional information that could be relevant to laptops prices.
